**Link to project:**:

### This API is actively under construction

**Tech used:**
- This API was created using Node.js and Express.js


## Optimizations
- Importing data to MongoDB to handle the expanding database

- Rehosting on another API site, given that Heroku is shutting down free access


## Lessons Learned:

This was my first practice with building something using Windows Subsystem for Linux, which led to me having to figure out how to manage a new environment mid-project. Working with WSL instead of bash has been a struggle with wondering why my CLI tools are missing, but I finally got this simple project together and deployed.
