## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
- This API was created using Node.js and Express.js


## Optimizations
- Importing data to MongoDB to handle the expanding database

- Rehosting on another API site, given that Heroku is shutting down free access


## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
